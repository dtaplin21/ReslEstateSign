ðŸš€ Ready to Build!
You can now take these artifacts directly to Cursor or Replit and start implementing:

Copy the database schema â†’ Set up PostgreSQL
Use the code examples â†’ Build your FastAPI backend
Follow the API spec â†’ Create your Next.js frontend
Execute the roadmap â†’ Track your daily progress

ðŸ’¡ Immediate Next Actions:

Set up your development environment (Week 1, Day 1-2)
Create the database using the schema
Initialize the Next.js project with the specified dependencies
Set up DocuSign and OpenAI API accounts
Start with the authentication system (Week 1, Day 3-4)

The system architecture diagram shows how everything connects, and the roadmap gives you a clear path from concept to production. Each artifact builds on the others to create a complete development blueprint.
Would you like me to create any additional supporting materials, such as:

Frontend component examples (React/Next.js)
Deployment configuration files (Docker, Kubernetes)
Testing strategies and example test cases
CI/CD pipeline configurations
